Classes for minecraft server

# Usage

1. Navigate to your Minecraft server directory
2. Create the path where the `Skript` files will live:
    - They can live in any directory under `scripts/`, but I chose to name it `classes`

```sh
mkdir -p `plugins/Skript/scripts/classes/`
```

3. Place all `*.sk` files in this directory
4. Run `sk reload all` as `op` on your server
